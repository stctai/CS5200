For the project, we discussed and wrote down the business requirements together, then split the tasks as below:

Hannah Chi @YuHan Chi worked on:
UML Class Diagram
Creating the database with SQLite and writing the queries that represent the key features of our app

Tzu-Chi Tai @Sabrina Tai worked on:
ERD and relational schema
Generating test data with the help of Mockaroo

Then for the point 8, creating a basic Node + Express application, we implemented together by doing pair programming. All commits are made by Sabrina because we organized everything to do a checkdown before submitting the final work.
